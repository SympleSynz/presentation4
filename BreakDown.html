<li>Introduction - Text Editors</li>
<script>
Other than a computer, the most important tool for a software engineer is the environment they use to write their programs. Programming languages in Python, C++, C, C#, Haskel, Scala and many others can be done from different environments including Codeblocks, Visual Basic, Geany, VIM, EMACS, Sublime Text, etc. But what makes one environment better than the other? In two words, personal preference. Each environment has its pros and cons and programmers (or the business they work for) will decide what is necessary and what is not for a programming environment. Sublime Text 2/3 is a popular text editor among University of Colorado Boulder computer science majors due to it being lightweight, customizable and the cross-platforming between Ubuntu, Mac and Windows.
