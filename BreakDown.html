<li>Introduction - Text Editors</li>
<script>
Other than a computer, the most important tool for a software engineer is the environment they use to write their programs. Programming languages in Python, C++, C, C#, Haskel, Scala and many others can be done from different environments including Codeblocks, Visual Basic, Geany, VIM, EMACS, Sublime Text, etc. But what makes one environment better than the other? In two words, personal preference. Each environment has its pros and cons and programmers (or the business they work for) will decide what is necessary and what is not for a programming environment. Sublime Text 2/3 is a popular text editor among University of Colorado Boulder computer science majors due to it being lightweight, customizable and the cross-platforming between Ubuntu, Mac and Windows.

<li>Sublime Text Background</li>
<script>
"Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose" [1]. The text editor has a Python API and can extend functionality for users through plugins. Currently, Sublime Text is community-built and maintained under free-software licenses [2]. It’s a proprietary software, which is software that doesn’t meet the criteria to be free or open source and license revenue accrues to the developer. Most people can use this software for free, without penalty, but it will frequently ask for financial support. According to Wikipedia, Joe Skinner is the initial developer for Sublime Text, releasing the first version on 18 January 2008 and the first stable release was version 2.0.2 on 8 July 2013. The code used to create the text editor is Python and C++. Sublime Text natively supports many programming languages and markup languages such as the following: <img src="Images/NativeLanguages.png">

Recently, in March, they released the latest version or build, sublime text 3, which fixed the high CPU usage, fixed a crash of the command palette, and controlled tab completion. They frequently update with new builds in order to stay on the upmost technology [2].

<li>IDE vs Text Editors</li>
<script>
As mentioned on stack over flow, "An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, which allows for more than only writing code. IDEs allow for compiling, running and debugging of the actual code written in the IDE. Text editors usually use a broader approach in being able to write and edit many types of files and languages instead of specializing in a particular type. Plugins can typically be added to many text editors for specific files and languages that will compile, run and debug, but since this functionality is a plugin, it isnt considered as 'integrated'." [3].

<li>Features</li>
<script>
Sublime Text supports many plugins and features, such as 22 different visual themes, including customization options, a minimap feature that allows a reduced overview to the right of the screen, a python-based plugin API, Goto anything allowing for quick navigation to files, symbols, or lines, project specific preferences, compatibility with language grammar, simultaneous editing, and cross-platform ability that includes OSX, Windows, and Ubuntu. The user only needs one license to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter what operating system it uses. The program also offers a variety of screen modes, which allows the files or folders to be opened to the left of the screen for easier accessibility. The column selection and multi-select editing feature allows the user to select entire sections at once, or multiple cursor areas at once, to allow simultaneous editing. This allows for efficient coding. Snippets are giving the user the ability to assign keywords to the saved blocks of frequently used code. The user can then type the keyword and press tab to paste the block of code whenever they require it. Goto anything is a tool that allows users to switch between open, recent or project files and also navigate to symbols within them. Sublimes auto save capability prevents users from losing work. According to Wikipedia, “Package Control is a third-party package manager for Sublime Text which allows the user to find, install, upgrade and remove plug-ins, usually without restarting Sublime Text.” This manager will keep the packages up to date as well. 

Some quick commands for some of these features: The user can also Use Multiple Selections to rename variables quickly by highlighting the desired word and using the ⌘d (cntl d) to select the next occurrence of the current word.
For example, in the below pictures, by placing the cursor within multiple locations the user can change one variable more efficiently. Notice len -> length.
