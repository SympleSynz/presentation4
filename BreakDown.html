<li>Introduction - Text Editors</li>
<script>
Other than a computer, the most important tool for a software engineer is the environment they use to write their programs. Programming languages in Python, C++, C, C#, Haskel, Scala and many others can be done from different environments including Codeblocks, Visual Basic, Geany, VIM, EMACS, Sublime Text, etc. But what makes one environment better than the other? In two words, personal preference. Each environment has its pros and cons and programmers (or the business they work for) will decide what is necessary and what is not for a programming environment. Sublime Text 2/3 is a popular text editor among University of Colorado Boulder computer science majors due to it being lightweight, customizable and the cross-platforming between Ubuntu, Mac and Windows.

<li>Sublime Text Background</li>
<script>
"Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose" [1]. The text editor has a Python API and can extend functionality for users through plugins. Currently, Sublime Text is community-built and maintained under free-software licenses [2]. It’s a proprietary software, which is software that doesn’t meet the criteria to be free or open source and license revenue accrues to the developer. Most people can use this software for free, without penalty, but it will frequently ask for financial support. According to Wikipedia, Joe Skinner is the initial developer for Sublime Text, releasing the first version on 18 January 2008 and the first stable release was version 2.0.2 on 8 July 2013. The code used to create the text editor is Python and C++. Sublime Text natively supports many programming languages and markup languages such as the following: <img src="Images/NativeLanguages.png">

<li>IDE vs Text Editors</li>
<script>
As mentioned on stack over flow, "An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, which allows for more than only writing code. IDEs allow for compiling, running and debugging of the actual code written in the IDE. Text editors usually use a broader approach in being able to write and edit many types of files and languages instead of specializing in a particular type. Plugins can typically be added to many text editors for specific files and languages that will compile, run and debug, but since this functionality is a plugin, it isnt considered as an integrated." [3].
